## Overview

In this module, I got started with PyTorch --- the deep learning
framework that revolutionized model development by making it as
intuitive as writing Python code.

I progressed from understanding a single artificial neuron that models
linear relationships to building multi-neuron networks capable of
learning complex patterns using activation functions. Throughout the
module, I built and trained my first neural network models, explored how
tensors represent data, and implemented the complete machine learning
pipeline in PyTorch.

This module laid the foundation for understanding how deep learning
systems are structured, trained, and evaluated.


## What I Learned

-   How PyTorch is designed and why it is widely used in deep learning
-   How a single neuron models linear relationships
-   How to build multi-layer neural networks
-   How activation functions enable models to learn complex patterns
-   How to train and evaluate neural networks
-   How tensors work and how to perform tensor operations
-   How to implement the full machine learning pipeline in PyTorch


## Learning Objectives Achieved

-   Understood PyTorch's design philosophy and core advantages
-   Built and trained neural networks from single neurons to multi-layer
    architectures
-   Implemented the machine learning pipeline in PyTorch
-   Mastered tensor fundamentals and essential operations


## Key Concepts Covered

## Conclusion

By completing this module, I developed a strong foundational
understanding of PyTorch and deep learning fundamentals. I can now
confidently build, train, and evaluate basic neural network models, and
I am prepared to move on to more advanced workflows and architectures.
