## Course Overview

This course introduced me to the core principles of deep learning
through hands-on coding in PyTorch. I started by learning how PyTorch
represents data using tensors and how datasets and data loaders fit into
the training process.

Step by step, I built and trained neural networks, experimented with
different architectures, and explored how models learn from examples. I
also learned how to monitor training progress, interpret results, and
evaluate model performance effectively.

By the end of the course, I understood the complete PyTorch workflow and
became confident in designing, training, and testing my own neural
networks.
