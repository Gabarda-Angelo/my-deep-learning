## Overview

In this module, I explored Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
learned how they extract meaningful patterns from images.

I studied how convolutional filters detect edges, textures, and spatial
features, how pooling layers reduce dimensions while preserving
important information, and how these components combine into complete
CNN architectures. I also learned how PyTorch's dynamic computation
graphs allow flexibility between using simple Sequential models and
building custom, modular architectures with nn.Module.

By the end of this module, I built CNN models with dropout, weight
decay, and inspection tools to debug shape mismatches and better
understand model parameters.
