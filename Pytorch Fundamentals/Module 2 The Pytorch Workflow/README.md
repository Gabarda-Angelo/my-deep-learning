## Overview

In this module, I transitioned from regression problems to image
classification, working with real image datasets and building models
capable of recognizing visual patterns.

I learned how to manage image datasets using PyTorch's transforms,
Dataset, and DataLoader. I moved beyond simple Sequential models and
started building more flexible architectures using nn.Module. I also
deepened my understanding of how neural networks learn through loss
functions, gradients, and optimization.

Throughout this module, I applied GPU acceleration for faster
computation and trained complete classifiers for digits and letters from
start to finish.


## What I Learned

-   How to load and preprocess image datasets using transforms
-   How to structure custom datasets with Dataset and DataLoader
-   How to build models using nn.Module
-   How loss functions guide model learning
-   How gradients and backpropagation update model parameters
-   How optimizers improve model performance
-   How to use CPU and GPU devices properly
-   How to train and evaluate an image classifier end to end


## Learning Objectives Achieved

-   Used PyTorch's pipeline to load, process, and train on image data
-   Applied loss functions and optimizers to train models effectively
-   Managed devices to run models reliably on CPU or GPU
-   Built and trained a full image classifier that generalizes to test
    data


## Key Concepts Covered

-   Image preprocessing and data augmentation\
-   Dataset and DataLoader workflow\
-   Custom model architecture with nn.Module\
-   Loss functions and optimization\
-   GPU acceleration\
-   Training, validation, and testing pipeline


## Conclusion

By completing this module, I gained practical experience working with
image data and training classifiers. I now understand how to structure
deep learning workflows for computer vision tasks and how to ensure that
models generalize beyond the training dataset.
